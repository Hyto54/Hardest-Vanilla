# Hardest Vanilla Minecraft Datapack

## Description
Hardest Vanilla makes Minecraft significantly harder while preserving the vanilla experience.  
No armor protection, no natural regeneration, stronger mobs at night, and more to come soon.
Perfect for players seeking a brutal challenge.

## Features
- Armor gets deleted as soon as it is worn.  
- Natural health regeneration is disabled (gamerule applied).  
- Death triggers spectator modeâ€”no respawns.  
- Recipes must be unlocked (gamerule applied).  
- Universal mob anger enabled.  
- Mobs gain strengh, speed and resistance effects during nighttime.
- Angered neutral mobs spread anger toward nearby players to nearby neutral mobs (even if angered by another mob).
- The Wither is closer to the bedrock Wither.
- The Ender Dragon has 1000 max hp but starts off with 200 making the ender dragon fight a race against time.
